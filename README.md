I created this mini project when I joined the Rakamin Triall Class Data Science event.

The dataset used in this mini portfolio is transaction data from an online retail company. The transaction data occurred in 2009-2011 with a total of more than 1 million data. Processing is done on the data to analyze how sales are performing within those 3 years.
